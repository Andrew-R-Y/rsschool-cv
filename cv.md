### About

Currently I'm a pipeline engineer at small oil pipeline design company at position Chief Specialist. I have experience in oil pipeline calculations and design, and experience in general customer office as a technical contractor. I like physics and mathematics and I'm intresting in coding. 

I started to learn JavaScript at summer 2022 from 11-hours YouTube video by Bogdan Stashchuk and freeCodeCamp platform. At this moment I have done all the algoritmic tasks at Stage #0 RS School and all (56) tasks in Codewars of Stage #0. My best qualities are persistence and drive for results.
